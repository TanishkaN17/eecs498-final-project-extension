Accuracy of meaning: The phrase conveys that someone fell, which is the core meaning. The use of \"ऊपर गिर गया\" is a common Hindi idiom where \"ऊपर\" adds emphasis to the falling action.\n\n2. Naturalness and fluency: \"He fell down\" is natural, fluent English that native speakers would use in everyday conversation.\n\n3. Cultural appropriateness: The translation appropriately handles the Hindi idiomatic expression and converts it to natural English without literal word-for-word translation that would sound awkward.\n\n4. Grammatical correctness: The sentence is grammatically correct with proper subject-verb agreement and tense (simple past).\n\n5. Tone preservation: The simple, direct tone of the original Hindi is maintained in the English translation.",
