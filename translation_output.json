The phrasing \"extremely lengthy\" is a more natural and appropriate way to convey this meaning compared to the more literal \"very long.\"\n\nBoth translations preserve the tone and cultural appropriateness equally well, but the critic's version demonstrates a stronger command of English language and translation principles.

Cultural Appropriateness: The critic's translation is more culturally appropriate, as \"the apple of one's eye\" is a widely recognized English idiom that captures the metaphorical and poetic nature of the original Hindi expression.\n\n4.
